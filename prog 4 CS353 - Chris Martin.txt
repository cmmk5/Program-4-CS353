I started off by creating the structs for location, item, and current state.
Then I created functions for all items, cave locations, state of the game, and the secret room.
Also created functions for listing items, location you are currently at in cave.
The next functions are your movements, picking up and dropping items, searching areas, and a function that helps you out.
Then I created the actual ways you can go, search, describe, inventory, help, quit, take, and drop.
Lastly, I created the loop that the game will run off of and a message that welcomes you to my game.

I had ChatGPT help me out with the over all outline of the program, I was kind of confused where to actual start with this game. But once I saw the outline I just kind of based it off of that and entered my text and functions.
The way it outlines the game really helped me out because it showed me what I should be doing, detailed how everything worked, and showed me how to start off the program.
I honestly enjoyed working along LLMs this semester it really taught me a lot about LLMs, how to use them, and helped my coding out. I wasn't the biggest fan of Racket to be honest, but I did enjoy your class and learning a new language. Next time I take a class that works along side LLMs I would like to branch out and use different ones, I kind of only used ChatGPT this semester because I am so familiar with it, but I wished I would have tried some other ones out.
